## DRM172: Half bridge LLC converter based on mc56f8xxxx
This is an LLC resonant converter reference design using MC56F8xxxx DSC.

The 56F8xxxx microcontroller is a member of the 32-bit 56800EX core-based Digital Signal Controllers (DSCs). Each device in the family combines, on a single chip, the processing power of a 32-bit DSP and the functionality of a microcontroller with a flexible set of peripherals. Due to its cost-effectiveness, configuration flexibility, and compact program code, 56F8xxxx is well-suited for many consumers and industrial applications.

Please refer to [DRM172](https://www.nxp.com/webapp/sps/download/preDownload.jsp?render=true) for complete instructions on how to use this software.

## 1. Software<a name="step1"></a>
The software for this Application Note is delivered in raw source files and CodeWarrior projects. There are three projects based on different control cards.
- Download and install [CodeWarrior 11.1](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/codewarrior-development-tools/codewarrior-legacy/codewarrior-for-mcus-eclipse-ide-coldfire-56800-e-dsc-qorivva-56xx-rs08-s08-s12z-11-1:CW-MCU10) and [CodeWarrior for MCU 11.1 Update 4](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/codewarrior-development-tools/codewarrior-legacy/codewarrior-for-mcus-eclipse-ide-coldfire-56800-e-dsc-qorivva-56xx-rs08-s08-s12z-11-1:CW-MCU10). 
- Download and install the latest version of [FreeMASTER](https://www.nxp.com/freemaster).

## 3. Setup<a name="step3"></a>
* Download the firmware to the control chip by connecting a debugger (USB TAP or P&E-Multilink) to SWD port of the control board using a 14-pin cable.
* Plug in the control card, connect the input voltage and load to setup the development enviroment. If you want to control and monitor the working status of the system, using FreeMaster by connecting the micro interface on the control card to the PC through a micro USB cable.
* Input power on, then the system starts working.


## 4. Results<a name="step4"></a>
* 12V output ripple is less than 170mV;
* Dynamic: Vout less than 5%(600mV) change @ 0%~65% load change;
* Peak Efficiency is higher than 92%;
* Peak temperature less than 90°C at full loading output;

## 5. FAQs<a name="step5"></a>
**5.1 How to control the on/off the converter?**

A control variable LLC_RUN is defined in the project to control the switch of the converter. When LLC_RUN=1, the converter is allowed to run. When LLC_RUN=0, the converter stops working. LLC_RUN can be modified by FreeMaster.

**5.2 How does the LLC connect to the pre-stage PFC to work?**

- Connect the LLC input to the pre-stage PFC output.
- Connect the communication port. J10 on the LLC board is a reserved UART communication port for communication with the front-end PFC.

**5.3 How to use FreeMASTER to control the system?**

Get a basic idea of FreeMASTER with [FreeMASTER User Guide](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/FMSTERUG.pdf).
